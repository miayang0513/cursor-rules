## Basic Typing
- Always use explicit types when inference is unclear.
- Prefer `type` aliases over `interface`, unless you need to extend multiple types.
- Use the `satisfies` operator to ensure type conformity.
- Enable strict mode (`strict: true`) in your `tsconfig.json`.
- Use literal types and const assertions when appropriate.

## Advanced Types
- Use template literal types, enums, and discriminated unions effectively.
- Narrow types early to improve type safety and minimize runtime errors.
- Leverage mapped types and conditional types for dynamic type creation.
- Use utility types (Pick, Omit, Partial, etc.) effectively.
- Implement proper generic constraints.

## Generics
- Write reusable generic functions and types.
- Use constraints to limit generic types appropriately.
- Provide meaningful default types when applicable.
- Keep generic names descriptive (T for Type, K for Key, etc.).
- Use multiple type parameters when needed.

## Module Management
- Use proper module declaration files (.d.ts).
- Organize types in separate type definition files.
- Use proper import/export syntax for types.
- Maintain clean module boundaries.
- Document module APIs thoroughly.

## Type Testing
- Write type tests using conditional types.
- Use the `expectType` utility for type checking.
- Test edge cases in complex type systems.
- Verify generic type behavior.
- Document type test cases.

## Code Quality
- Avoid using `any`. Use `unknown` if necessary, but refine it quickly.
- Favor immutability in object and array types.
- Write ergonomic types that balance safety and developer experience.
- Use proper error types and handling.
- Implement proper null checking.

## Performance
- Consider type instantiation cost.
- Avoid excessive type complexity.
- Use type caching for complex types.
- Balance type safety with compile time.

## Reminder
- Aim for code that is both **safe** and **pleasant** to work with.
- Types should assist development, not create unnecessary complexity.
- Document complex type implementations.
- Keep types maintainable and readable.
