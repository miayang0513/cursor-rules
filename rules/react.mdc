## Components and Hooks
- Use function components exclusively.
- Use React hooks correctly; avoid misuse of `useEffect` for data fetching.
- Embrace the new actions and form actions APIs.
- Keep components focused and single-responsibility.
- Implement proper prop validation with TypeScript.

## State Management
- Choose appropriate state management level:
  - Local state for component-specific data
  - Context for shared state within a subtree
  - Global state only when absolutely necessary
- Implement proper state immutability
- Use reducers for complex state logic
- Consider server state management tools when needed

## Error Handling
- Implement Error Boundaries at appropriate levels
- Use Suspense for loading states
- Handle async errors gracefully
- Provide meaningful error messages to users
- Log errors appropriately for debugging

## Performance Optimization
- Use `useMemo`, `useCallback`, and React Compiler features appropriately.
- Avoid prop drilling; use context API or local state collocation.
- Keep components pure whenever possible.
- Implement proper code splitting with lazy loading
- Use proper key props in lists

## Testing Strategy
- Write unit tests for complex logic
- Test component rendering and interactions
- Mock external dependencies appropriately
- Test error scenarios and edge cases
- Use React Testing Library best practices

## Accessibility
- Use semantic HTML elements
- Implement proper ARIA attributes
- Ensure keyboard navigation works
- Test with screen readers
- Follow WCAG guidelines

## Rendering
- Prefer streaming and partial hydration techniques.
- Minimize unnecessary re-renders with proper memoization.

## Reminder
- Always align with the "functional and declarative" mindset.
- Prioritize code simplicity and maintainability.
- Consider performance implications of your choices.
- Write tests for critical functionality.
